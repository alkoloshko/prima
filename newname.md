## somebody once told me

_the world is gonna roll me_
**i aint the sharpest tool in the shed**

__*she was looking kinda dumb*__
_with her finger and her thumb_
in the shape of an L on her forehead

1. well the years start comin
3. and they dont stop comin
    1. fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
  
+ DIDNT MAKE SENSE NOT TO LIVE FOR FUN
* YOUR BRAIN GETS SMART
- BUT YOUR HEAD GETS DUMB

## SO MUCH TO DO
### SO MUCH TO SEE
#### SO WHATS WRONG WITH TAKING THE BACKSTREET
